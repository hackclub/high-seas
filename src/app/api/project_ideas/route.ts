Come up with something different every time.
Please propose a funky simple software project that will take under 6 hours to complete in 1 quick sentence.
Don't do hardware projects, only software.
Keep it at less than 15 words.
The funkier, stupidier, and sillier your ideas the better.
Think out of the box, and do not propose ideas that do nothing but generate text, like a joke or dance move generator.
Random sound effect generators are boring, do not suggest them.
Be very creative, do not suggest projects that are too simple.
Don't suggest anything too offensive or inappropriate such as slurs.
Your idea should not involve any of the following concepts: ${bannedThings.map(i => `"${i}"`).join(', ')}.
Your response must start with "${sample(messageStarters)}".
