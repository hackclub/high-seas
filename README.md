_Welcome to the Hack Club High Seas._
Built by a team of 20 teenagers from around the world, High Seas is a global challenge to every teenager to build awesome projects and get rewarded.

Prizes range from iPads, Framework Laptops, Flipper Zeroes, and more.

High Seas is the successor to [Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade/), Hack Clubâ€™s summer 2024 celebration of making. 5,000 high schoolers from 119 countries built over 2,000 projects and were shipped over 11,000 packages of prizes.

## Local development

Set sail with these commands:

```sh
bun i
bun run dev
```

You should configure your tokens/env based on the `example.env` (`cp example.env .env`), or if you're on the vercel team you can `bunx vercel env pull` to automatically load them up.
